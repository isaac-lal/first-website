            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Isaac Lal and I am striving to become a Software Engineer in the future.<br><br>
            
            Currently, I’m a lower sophomore at Hunter College and studying Computer Science as my major. 
            On top of being determined to excel in all my classes, I am also working at coding internships to 
            obtain additional work experience and further progress my skillset. <br><br>
                
            On the side, I’m working on my own personal projects such as developing my own website, 
            coding my own game, and understanding the fundamental concepts of coding and development.<br><br>
                
            As I continue in my career, the prospect of becoming a Software Engineer is in sight, 
            and I am determined to endure and overcome these challenges in order to make that prospect come true!</p>
